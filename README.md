## NEW FEATURES

## ‚å®Ô∏è  Vim/Custom key bindings

You can now do everything using KEYBOARD!
This is first version so if you have any suggestions please write them in existing issue.  
Default keybindings are in `default_bindings.toml`
file that is in root of installation.  
You can also create second file `user_bindings.toml` where you can overwrite defaults.

### What you can do

* Change focus `focus_next/focus_previous` using `ctrl+i,ctrl+j/ctrl+o,ctrl+k`
* Edit note `edit` using `i`
* When note is focused you can move it with `j/k/l/h`.
  Also adding shift moves it more with one click
* Clicking `unfocus` using `escape` returns from edit mode,
  and unfocus drawable if not in edit mode.
* Resize note using `+/-` for vertical and `>/<` for horizontal
* Bring 'ctrl+f' Forward and `ctrl+b` Backward Note

## TODO

There are many thigs to add! If you have idea, please create Issue with your suggestions.

* [ ] Safe saving (now if there are any bugs you may lost your notes)
* [x] Vim Key bindings
  * Wait for feedback
* [ ] Duplicate Note
* [ ] Hiding menu (Color Picker etc.)
* [x] TOML config file
* [ ] Left Sidebar (for background and preferences)
* [ ] Align tool for text
* [ ] Fixed layers (if needed)
* [ ] Diffrent Drawables:
  * [ ] Check List
  * [ ] Arrows

and also resolve problems:
